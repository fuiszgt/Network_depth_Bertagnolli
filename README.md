# Network depth in protein interaction networks

Code to run experiments based on the paper __Network depth: identifying median and contours in complex networks__ by Bertagnolli et al., 2019: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05060 

__Goal__: Apply Network Depth as a node centrality measure in a protein interaction network of neurodegenerative diseases.
